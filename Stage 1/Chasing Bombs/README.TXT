AUTHOR: Wai Shan (Karen) Yip
EXPLANATION: 
This assignment focuses on GUI Application. This is a single player game with the aim of pressing a square and hopefully avoiding a bomb that is hidden under a random square. Each time the player presses a square that does not uncover a bomb, they gain 1 point. If the bomb is revealed, it will detonate and this will end the game. The 3 difficulty levels are Easy, Intermediate and Difficult. If Easy is chosen, the player will win after 5 safe choices, 7 safe choices for Intermediate and then all the squares need to be uncovered safely for Difficult.                                                                                   

The JFrame is divided into 3 panels vertically. The left panel contains the gameboard of 10 squares, the middle panel contains the buttons to start/restart the game as well as exit, and the score is displayed here too. The right panel contains the buttons that are used to select the difficulty level.
